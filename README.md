# Leetcode-problems
All codes I've written for LeetCode problems.

Problems are chosen at random. I skip any problem whose solution is too apparent to me, so most of the problems I did are rated medium in difficulty.

The vast majority of files are complete and I have verified that they produce the correct results (including any special cases that I can think of).

For a few especially difficult problems, I did as much as I can.

(Most) classes are named as "(problemName)(problemNumber).class".
